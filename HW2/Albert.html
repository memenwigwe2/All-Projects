      <b>10 Things You Didn’t Know About Albert Einstein:</b>
    </center>
    <ul>
      <li>
        He never failed math. This is a popular “fact” promoted on the internet,
        maybe in an attempt to relate to genius. However, it is simply not true.
        Overall, Einstein was an average student, but math was one area where he
        excelled, unsurprisingly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His involvement
        is often misinterpreted, with some claiming that he helped create the
        atom bomb. In reality, what he did was write a letter to President FDR
        encouraging him to begin work on such a weapon, which led to the
        Manhattan Project. Although a dedicated pacifist and, later, an
        anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein was convinced that America needed the
        atomic bomb before the Nazis.
      </li>

      <li>
        He was a great musician. If the whole “genius” thing didn’t work out,
        Einstein could have become a violinist. His mother played piano so he
        had the love of music instilled in him—via violin lessons—at the young
        age of five.
      </li>

      <li>
        He could have been the President of Israel. When Israel’s first
        president, Chaim Weizmann, died, Einstein was offered the position, but
        he declined. He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first
        wife, Mileva Maric, he married his cousin, Elsa Lowenthal. He was,
        actually, quite a bad husband to his first wife in their later years. He
        had affairs he never tried to hide, he moved the entire family to Berlin
        without discussion, and treated her more as a servant than a wife.
      </li>

      <li>
        He won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics. This alone isn’t particularly
        surprising. What is surprising is the fact that he didn’t receive it for
        the general or special theory of relativity, but rather for the
        photoelectric effect.
      </li>

      <li>
        He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a hobby. But
        by his own admission, he never made a particularly good sailor. In fact,
        he didn’t even know how to swim
      </li>

      <li>
        He really didn’t like socks, and usually didn’t wear them. In fact, in a
        letter to Elsa, he bragged about getting away “without wearing socks”
        while at Oxford.
      </li>

      <li>
        He had an illegitimate daughter. This wasn’t known until the 1980s, but
        according to correspondence between Albert and Mileva it was determined
        that the two had a daughter in 1902 called Lieserl. At one point, all
        mention of her in letters stopped so her fate is unknown.
      </li>

      <li>
        His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did his
        autopsy took his brain without permission. He eventually got the
        permission necessary from Einstein’s son, but he was fired from
        Princeton when he refused to turn the brain over. He kept it for over
        forty years before finally returning it in 1998.
      </li>
